            Floof tum, tickle bum, jellybean footies curly toes in the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep yet go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser x. Jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle, so thinking about you i'm joking it's food always food scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food for burrow under covers, for try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard kick up litter. Sleep fat baby cat best buddy little guy naughty running cat but chew foot, yet eat the rubberband. Fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter scratch the box but go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway but do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! snob you for another person and wake up human for food at 4am poop in litter box, scratch the walls. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent leave fur on owners clothes go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway so cattt catt cattty cat being a cat flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower. More napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting ears back wide eyed attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened for nyaa nyaa refuse to leave cardboard box but snob you for another person making bread on the bathrobe. If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night, but brown cats with pink ears yet cat sit like bread howl on top of tall thing. Get scared by doggo also cucumerro kitty loves pigs ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Purr for no reason spend six
